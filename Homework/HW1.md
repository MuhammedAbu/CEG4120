# 7 Reasons Why Software Projects Fail

**Author**: Muhammed Abushamma  
*CEG4120 - Managing the Software Development Cycle*

Among the software community, there is a commonly recited adage most learn while still an undergrad: "The majority of software projects do not succeed."

### What do the stats say?
The Standish Group’s CHAOS report estimates that around 66% of software projects either fail (24%) or are challenged (44%). A project failure, as defined by The Standish Group, is a project that’s canceled before completion or never used after delivery. A challenged project is one that is delivered but does not meet time, budget, and/or performance expectations.

Knowing this, it is no wonder that blogs about how and why software projects fail litter the internet and sprawl across software forums and company blog sites. Understanding why software projects fail or are challenged after delivery is useful for anyone involved in the software development process, including but not limited to the client, product owner, project manager, developer, and tester. For freelancers, it is even more pertinent to understand the software process since they often bear the sole responsibility for the non-technical aspects of a project, such as planning and management.

Understanding the pitfalls of the software process and cycle can save stakeholders from the inevitable—and sometimes incredibly costly—failure of a software project.

Here, I list the top 8 reasons I believe software projects fail, starting with the most important.

## 1. Unclear Requirements

A project with unclear requirements is like construction workers trying to build a house with half-torn and coffee-stained blueprints; that is, the property owner would be lucky if the house got finished at all, let alone to their desired specifications. Without a guiding vision and a clear understanding of how a software solution should be built, a software project is doomed to fail. Everyone—from developers to managers to business leaders—will be unable to do their essential tasks properly, such as choosing the correct tech stack for the job, allocating the proper budget, or creating a healthy backlog and timeline.

## 2. Not Enough Training on the Tech Stack

Familiarity with the chosen tech stack is crucial. An unfamiliarity with it will cause team members to resort to workarounds or miss out on clear optimizations. If this is the case, the project’s technical debt will accumulate, slowing down development and reducing the quality of the delivered software.

## 3. Poor Communication

Poor communication is characterized by not knowing what questions to ask, not asking enough questions, not clarifying with all team members and stakeholders, not understanding the end-user, or failing to communicate directly with them. Regular check-ins are also crucial. The key here is to over-communicate.

It is guaranteed that at least one person in a conversation will not absorb everything said—they may get distracted at certain points or misunderstand something. This is even more the case in groups. It’s important to gauge understanding and repeat yourself if needed. Likewise, gauge your own understanding and ask clarifying questions when necessary.

## 4. Scope Creep

Scope creep is the gradual expansion of a project's goals beyond the original vision. This usually happens due to poor communication, undefined requirements, or lack of proper management. Scope creep can easily get out of hand and throw off a project's completion, as deadlines are pushed back or features are scrapped. This is especially problematic if an unfinished feature that wasn’t part of the original requirements is added, interfering with the rest of the project’s functionality. The entire project's success may then depend on this one unfinished or deferred feature.

## 5. Lack of Documentation

Documentation should outline the high-level architecture, technology stack, and a comprehensive roadmap. A lack of documentation means there’s no clear guide for design, development, implementation, testing, or deployment, leading to confusion, delays, and potential rework. Documentation serves as a reference to ensure all team members are aligned and the project progresses smoothly.

## 6. Unclear Post-Delivery Expectations

Establishing clear agreements on maintenance responsibilities helps avoid misunderstandings and future issues. Define a maintenance and versioning plan early in the project. Stakeholders should clarify who will manage updates, bug fixes, and version control, and ensure these details are included in the project contract. If maintenance falls to the client, offering documentation or training can help facilitate a smooth transition. A clear, post-delivery agreement benefits both the client and the team.

## 7. Forgetting About the End-User

Understanding your customer means building features that users truly want, continuously improving the end-user experience, differentiating your solution from the competition, and using real user feedback to inform decision-making. Keeping the customer in mind will lead to an overall enhancement in the quality of the software you build and increase business revenue.

## 8. Lack of Testing and Quality Assurance

Lack of testing and quality assurance happens when adequate testing isn't performed throughout the development process, often due to looming deadlines or changing requirements. Skimping on testing can be very costly. Bugs and performance issues that aren’t caught early can become very expensive and complex to fix later on.

Lack of testing results in software that may not function as intended, leading to issues such as dissatisfied customers, security breaches, and costly post-launch fixes. Testing should be integrated into every stage of development. Quality assurance teams must prioritize testing the most important areas, adjusting priorities based on the latest changes in the codebase and recent builds.

### Here's the response to that query:

**Why Software Projects Fail: 7 Key Reasons to Watch Out For**

Software development is an intricate process that blends technical expertise, clear communication, and careful planning. Yet, despite the best intentions, many software projects fall short of their goals or fail to deliver entirely. Understanding why this happens is crucial for ensuring project success. Below, we outline seven critical reasons why software projects fail, with an explanation of why each factor is so impactful.

#### 1. **Unclear Requirements**
One of the most common reasons software projects fail is a lack of clear and well-documented requirements. If the development team does not fully understand what the stakeholders want, the resulting product may miss the mark entirely. Clear, actionable, and detailed requirements form the foundation of successful projects; without them, teams risk wasting time and resources building features that do not meet users' needs.

#### 2. **Poor Project Management**
Inefficient project management can derail even the most promising software projects. This includes inadequate planning, lack of defined milestones, and failure to manage scope creep effectively. A skilled project manager ensures that resources, timelines, and deliverables are properly aligned, helping the team stay on track and avoid chaos.

#### 3. **Lack of Stakeholder Involvement**
When stakeholders are not actively engaged throughout the development process, projects are more likely to fail. Regular feedback and collaboration ensure that the final product aligns with stakeholder expectations. Without their involvement, critical adjustments may be overlooked, leading to dissatisfaction upon delivery.

#### 4. **Inadequate Testing**
Testing is often rushed or deprioritized due to tight deadlines, but inadequate testing can result in software riddled with bugs and performance issues. Thorough testing at each development stage is essential to identify and address problems early. Neglecting this step can lead to costly fixes, frustrated users, and damaged reputations.

#### 5. **Unrealistic Deadlines**
Pressure to deliver software quickly can lead to unrealistic expectations. When deadlines are not aligned with the complexity of the project, the team may cut corners or rush through critical stages of development. It’s important to set reasonable timelines that allow for comprehensive planning, design, development, and testing phases.

#### 6. **Technical Debt**
Accumulating technical debt—such as using shortcuts, poorly written code, or neglecting maintenance—can prevent software projects from reaching their full potential. Over time, these issues become harder to fix, slowing down development and reducing product quality. Managing technical debt through regular refactoring and good coding practices helps maintain project health.

#### 7. **Inflexible Teams**
Software development is an iterative process, and teams must be flexible enough to adapt to changes. If teams are rigid and unwilling to pivot based on new insights or shifting project needs, they may fail to deliver a product that meets market demand. Teams must be willing to adjust their strategies and goals as needed.

By recognizing these critical reasons and addressing them early in the development process, teams can significantly increase their chances of delivering successful software projects.

## Appendix B: Critique of LLM Response

I found Chatgpt's response to be adequate—not great nor terrible—but just ok. A common theme I get when I ask chatgpt questions is lots of info but no meaningful content. I can read essays worth of writing by LLMs and feel like I have learned a lot, but after trying to recall what is it I just learned I'm lost for words. 

ChatGPT, and other large language models (LLMs), don't offer advice by using real experience to guide it's insights into a topic, but instead regurgiate the most stale, cookie-cutter answers from the internet and largely uses verbose and euphemistic language. Not to mention most of the responses given by LLMs come in a listicle format, which is just an inferior method of communicating information as compared to books or real world experience. This was an issue I had when reading these articles when doing the assignment, since they are really only useful for professionals who already have real-world experience they could use to relate the info in the articles to. The majority of the info I gleamed from these listicles quickly escaped from my understanding, with the parts I could relate to with real world experience having more of a tangible impact.   

ChatGPT has a lot of incredible uses. Writing articles and literary compositions isn't one of them.

#### ChatGPT's Answer:
I find ChatGPT's response adequate—neither great nor terrible, but simply okay. A common theme I encounter when asking ChatGPT questions is a wealth of information with little meaningful content. I can read through essays generated by LLMs and feel like I've learned something, but when I try to recall what I've absorbed, I'm often at a loss for words.

ChatGPT, and other large language models (LLMs), don't offer advice derived from real experience. Instead, they regurgitate stale, cookie-cutter answers pulled from the internet, often wrapped in verbose and euphemistic language. Additionally, almost all the responses provided by LLMs come in a listicle format, which I find to be an inferior way of communicating information compared to books or firsthand experience. This was an issue I encountered while reading through the articles for this assignment, as they seem to be mainly useful for professionals who can relate the content to their own real-world experience. The majority of the information I gleaned from these listicles quickly faded from my understanding, with only the parts I could relate to real-world experience having any lasting impact.

While ChatGPT has many incredible uses, writing articles and literary compositions is not one of them.

## Appendix D: Writing Tip

Here’s a writing tip from the original homework instructions that I've found  very useful:

**Writing tip**: When asked to explain why a reason is important, avoid using phrases like "I think this is important because..." Good bloggers don’t write like that.

- **Weak**: "I think this is important because it’s hard to build a system when you don’t understand the requirements."
- **Improved**: "You can’t build a functioning system if you don’t understand what the user wants."
